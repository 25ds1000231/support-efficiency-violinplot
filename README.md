# Support Efficiency Violinplot

This repository contains a Seaborn violinplot visualization created for the customer analytics project: **Response Time Distribution by Support Channel**.

The Python script `chart.py` generates synthetic customer support resolution time data and produces a professional 512×512 violinplot (`chart.png`) as required for the analysis.
